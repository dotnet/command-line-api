There is an issue with redundant commands. You can see this in Add/Remove. Add/Remove will be used elsewhere and Package/Reference is already used. Three solutions I can think of:

- namespaces
- nested classes (I implemented this for package/reference)
- Allow/always prefix subcommands with their logical parent, and remove on generation

The third is my preferred and would result in 

> public class ProjectAddCommand where the "Project" part would be removed. 

I did this for List as we needed an immediate solution.
