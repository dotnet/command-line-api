# System.CommandLine Documentation

## Our goal

_Give your users a great experience with your .NET console applications while letting you focus on the application you're writing._

`System.CommandLine` is a set of libraries for building command line applications, including parsing, invocation, and rendering.

`System.CommandLine` sets out to:

* Reduce the time programmmers spend providing a command line API (CLI)
* Improve the experience of the users of CLI programs

You can read more about it here:

* [History](History.md)
* [Functional goals](Functional-goals.md)
* [Technical motivations](Technical-motivations.md)

## Try it out

The simplest way to create your parser is with the experimental [DragonFruit app model](DragonFruit-overview.md). This works well if you have a single layer of commands (no subcommands).

[Your first app with System.CommandLine.DragonFruit](Your-first-app-with-System-CommandLine-DragonFruit.md)

For more complex scenarios, you can use the core APIs directly.
