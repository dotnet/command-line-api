# Technical motivations

* Provide a parser that's independent of binding and invocation.

    * You can create your own conventions and your own API surface. 
    * Parsing can easily be tested independently from other application logic. 
    * The syntax abstraction opens up use cases such as an extensible completions model.
    * Features such as syntax validation can be customized independent of your API.
    * Grammars can be serialized for interpretation by other tools.
    * Different APIs using this base layer can interoperate easily.
    * Don't always assume a console app entry point: provide `Main(string[])`-equivalent string splitting.

* Make the end user command line experience consistent and inclusive.

    * Support both POSIX and Windows syntax conventions.
    * Make help easy to find by defaulting into all common conventions (`-h`, `--help`, `/h` `/?`, `-?`).
    * Make completions work by default, so that they become the norm.
    * Make it possible to write completion providers for non-.NET command line applications.
    * Localization support for all messages that the library emits.
    * Parse diagramming, to help people understand a program's syntax without invoking it, is available by default.

* A composable chain of responsibility for subcommand routing, middleware, directives, etc.

    * An invocation model that allows for short-circuiting and interception, with access to the parser, meaning cross-cutting behaviors can be composed into your app via NuGet packages.
    * Simplify debugging by providing an interception hook in the middleware pipeline.
    * Support for handling process cancellation.
    * Directive syntax provides a consistent extensibility point that does not interfere with your app's syntax.
    * Supports command line API versioning via directives.

* Rich, adapative output rendering
    * Write output code once and render it correctly based on the presence or absence of a terminal as well as terminal capabilities.
    * Support for higher-level layouts, tables, event-based re-rendering, and animation.
    * Support for standard render mode hints via directives.

* Other things:
    * Support arbitrarily deep nesting of subcommands.
    * Support response files.
    * Restore console state after application exit.
